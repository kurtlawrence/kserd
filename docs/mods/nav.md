Navigate around a [`Kserd`].

# Reading
It is cumbersome when trying to loop through a nested `Kserd` structure. There is a [`Navigator`]
structure that can be used that flattens the tree structure when constructed to make use of
indexing and iterators throughout the `Kserd`.

[`Kserd`]: crate::Kserd
[`Navigator`]: crate::nav::Navigator
